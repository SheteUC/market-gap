# Improved User Flow: Industry → Comprehensive Market Research

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Users had to manually select which consulting group to research, which didn't make sense from a user perspective. Why would a user care about individual consulting firms?

**After**: Users select their industry and the system automatically researches ALL major consulting firms to provide comprehensive market insights.

## 🔄 New Flow

### Step 1: Industry Selection
- **Page**: `/industry`
- **Action**: User selects their target industry (FinTech, Healthcare, etc.)
- **Button**: "Start Market Research" (instead of "Continue")
- **Result**: Immediately triggers comprehensive research

### Step 2: Comprehensive Market Research
- **Page**: `/research`
- **Process**: System automatically researches ALL consulting firms:
  - McKinsey & Company
  - Deloitte
  - Boston Consulting Group
  - Bain & Company
  - Accenture
- **Display**: Real-time progress and consolidated research output

## ✅ What Changed
