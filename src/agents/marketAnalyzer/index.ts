/**
 * Market-Analyzer Agent - Worker Agent for MarketGap AI
 *
 * Reads: consulting_docs memory block
 * Writes: gap_list memory block
 *
 * This worker is created by the Orchestrator and triggered once the consulting_docs
 * block has been populated with research data. It should not be instantiated directly
 * by the frontend or other workers.
 *
 * The agent relies primarily on the `run_code` built-in tool to perform TF-IDF analysis
 * over the white-paper snippets and fuse sentiment / pain signals to generate a ranked
 * list of ‚â§ 10 market gaps. The final JSON payload is persisted in the shared
 * `gap_list` memory block so that downstream agents (e.g. socialListener,
 * solutionGenerator) can consume it.
