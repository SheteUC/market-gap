/**
 * Social Listener Agent - Worker Agent for MarketGap AI
 *
 * Purpose: After the Market-Analyzer produces a gap list, this agent gathers
 * audience sentiment (Reddit) and high-level market context (Google search)
 * for each gap. It then stores the combined result in the `audience_signals`
 * shared memory block where the Solution-Generator will consume it.
 *
 * Custom Tools
 * 1. reddit_audience_research(keywords: string): string
 *    â€‘ Calls Reddit API (or Pushshift) to fetch recent posts/comments that
 *      mention the provided keywords, summarising demographics & sentiment.
 * 2. google_market_research(query: string): string
 *    â€‘ Performs a Google Custom Search (or SerpAPI) on the query and
 *      returns a concise summary of top results describing competitors,
 *      market size, and trends.
 *
 * The agent will iterate through the gaps, run both tools, and write an
 * array of objects to the audience_signals block:
 *   [{ gapId, redditInsights, googleInsights }]
