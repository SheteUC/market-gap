# Testing Steps 1-2: Industry Selection ‚Üí Market Research ‚Üí Output

This document explains how to test the first 2 steps of the MarketGap AI workflow to see the research process in action.

## üéØ What We're Testing

**Step 1**: Industry Selection  
**Step 2**: Comprehensive Market Research & Output Display  

The system now automatically researches ALL major consulting firms for the selected industry, eliminating the need for users to manually select consulting groups.

## üöÄ Quick Test (Web Interface)

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Follow the Workflow

1. **Industry Selection Page** (`/industry`)
   - Select any industry (e.g., "FinTech")
   - Click "Start Market Research"
   - This will:
     - Initialize all Letta agents
     - Start PDF crawling for ALL consulting firms
     - Navigate directly to the research page

2. **Market Research Analysis Page** (`/research`)
   - Shows real-time progress of the research across all consulting firms
   - Displays statistics (documents found, pages processed, patterns identified)
   - Shows the actual research output from the Letta agent
   - Refreshes every 5 seconds to get latest data

### 3. Expected Output

You should see:

- **Industry Context**: Alert showing which industry is being researched and how many consulting firms
- **Progress Bar**: Shows research progress across all firms
- **Step Indicators**: Current phase of research (Scanning ‚Üí Extracting ‚Üí Analyzing ‚Üí Complete)
- **Statistics Cards**: Real-time counts of documents and patterns found across all firms
- **Research Output Card**: Raw text output from the Market Research Agent showing:
  - Agent responses about PDF crawling from multiple firms
  - Tool calls and their results
  - Memory block updates with consolidated data
  - Processing status across all consulting firms

## üîß Alternative Testing Methods

### Method 1: API Testing

Test the endpoints directly:

```bash
# 1. Initialize agents
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agents/initialize

# 2. Start PDF crawling for ALL consulting firms
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agents/research \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "crawl_pdfs", "firmNames": ["McKinsey & Company", "Deloitte", "Boston Consulting Group", "Bain & Company", "Accenture"], "industry": "fintech"}'

# 3. Get research output
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents/research?type=chunks
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents/research?type=summary
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents/research?type=status
```

### Method 2: Test Script

Run the automated test:

```bash
npx ts-node src/scripts/testResearchFlow.ts
```

This will:
- Initialize agents
- Start PDF crawling for multiple consulting firms
- Wait 15 seconds
- Display all research outputs in the console

## üìä Understanding the Output

### What the Market Research Agent Does

The Market Research Agent now processes documents from ALL major consulting firms:

1. **Multi-Firm PDF Crawling**: Searches for and downloads PDFs from McKinsey, Deloitte, BCG, Bain, Accenture
2. **Text Extraction**: Uses PDFMiner to extract text from PDFs across all firms
3. **Content Chunking**: Splits documents into structured chunks (title, exec-summary, finding, table)
4. **PII Redaction**: Removes personally identifiable information
5. **Consolidated Storage**: Stores processed chunks from all firms in the `consulting_docs` memory block

### Expected Research Output Format

The agent will output messages like:

```
ü§ñ PDF Crawler: Starting comprehensive market research for FinTech industry. I'll crawl PDFs from McKinsey & Company, Deloitte, Boston Consulting Group, Bain & Company, and Accenture...

üîß Tool Called: search_consulting_pdfs
üîß Tool Called: extract_pdf_content
üîß Tool Called: chunk_pdf_content

ü§ñ PDF Crawler: Successfully processed 47 PDFs across 5 consulting firms, extracting 312 content chunks covering FinTech topics like digital banking, cryptocurrency, payment systems, and regulatory compliance. The consolidated data has been stored in my consulting_docs memory block.
```

### Research Data Structure

The research output now includes:

- **Multi-Firm Chunks**: Text extracted from PDFs across all consulting firms with source tags
- **Consolidated Processing Status**: Overall state of crawling across all firms
- **Comprehensive Memory State**: Agent's memory blocks containing data from all sources
- **Cross-Firm Analysis**: Ability to identify patterns across different consulting perspectives

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Research Output

**Possible Causes:**
- Letta API key not configured
- Network connectivity issues
- Agent initialization failed

**Solutions:**
1. Check your `.env.local` file has the correct `LETTA_API_KEY`
2. Verify the Letta service is accessible
3. Check browser console and server logs for errors

### Issue: Research Takes Too Long

**Expected Behavior:**
- Researching multiple consulting firms takes longer than single firm
- Real PDF processing can take 30+ seconds for comprehensive analysis

**Solutions:**
1. Be patient - comprehensive research takes time
2. Check the research status endpoint: `GET /api/agents/research?type=status`
3. Refresh the research page to get latest data

### Issue: Build Errors

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## üìù Key Files Modified

- `src/components/IndustrySelector.tsx` - Now triggers research for all firms
- `src/components/DocsCrawlerProgress.tsx` - Shows multi-firm research data
- `src/components/TopNav.tsx` - Removed consulting selection step
- `app/research/page.tsx` - Updated to reflect market research focus
- `app/industry/page.tsx` - Clarified what happens after industry selection

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when you see:

1. ‚úÖ Industry selection triggers comprehensive research
2. ‚úÖ Agents initialize successfully
3. ‚úÖ PDF crawling starts for multiple consulting firms
4. ‚úÖ Research output shows data from various sources
5. ‚úÖ Memory blocks contain consolidated data from all firms
6. ‚úÖ Progress updates reflect multi-firm analysis

The research output will show analysis across multiple consulting firms, providing a more comprehensive view of the market landscape than single-firm analysis.

## üîÑ Next Steps

Once steps 1-2 are working:

- **Step 3**: Market Analysis (identify gaps from consolidated research data)
- **Step 4**: Social Listening (gather audience insights)  
- **Step 5**: Solution Generation (brainstorm innovative solutions)

Each subsequent step now builds on comprehensive research data collected from multiple consulting firms, providing richer insights for market gap analysis.
